        <p>Goldilocks and the Three Bears:</p>

        <p>Goldilocks was a terrible read. Such a bad example for little kids of a girl who doesn't care about others feelings and just takes there stuff without asking. Unless you want your kids to be spoiled don't read it to them.
            Totally a 3/10.
