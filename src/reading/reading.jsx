      <p>Little Red Riding Hood was such a good book to read to my little kids. They loved it and want to hear it all the time now. Totally 10/10.</p>

      <p>Goldilocks was a terrible read. Such a bad example for little kidsâ€”teaching them to take things without asking. Unless you want your kids to be spoiled, don't read it to them. Totally a 3/10.</p>
