# The Writing Discussion


The Writing Discussion will be an online forum for book lovers to review books that they could possibly recommend. You can connect with friends to see their active readings. As well new writers can post their drafts and writings and get feedback from trusted readers whose opinions they value.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been a scared new writer who really wants to make their way in the world but has no idea how people will react? 
Have you ever been stuck trying to find a good book to read on a rainy day? Have you ever been so upset with the ending of your book 
you just need to talk to someone about it? These are all amazing reasons to use The Writing Discussion platform. 
With the ability to upload the newest snippet of your latest novel, the ability to read reviews and ratings from close friends 
and their most recently read books and the friends to talk to when the main character really makes you upset you'll never get 
tired of using The Writing Discussion platform. 

### Design

![Design image](startup.jpg)

There will be 3 separate options on which to pick. Whether you want to communicate or look at friends activity. Whether you want to browse or review a book. And, whether you want to upload a writing or review someone elses writing. From there it gets more specific and you can navigate through each of those options and have your own page to look at your activity.
